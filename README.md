# nba-data-exploration

This is a simple application that scrapes data from bbref and displays it in Streamlit, a Python library for data web apps.

Features:
- Filter to a single team
- Filter to a single season
- Sort by value (PPG, APG, etc.)
- Export to CSV

Features to add:
- Filter by years of experience (this will allow me to analyze rookie performances better, though sorting by age works for now)
- Interactive data visualizations based on the data present?? This would be interesting
